# FlexFuel Drones ‚Äì A Satisfactory Mod

**FlexFuel Drones** is a lightweight Satisfactory mod that enables Drones to use **Packaged Liquid Biofuel** as a valid fuel source ‚Äî because who says drones can‚Äôt go green? (Oh yeah, that's right... Coffee Stain Studios did! Whoops!)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ATTENTION: This mod has not been tested on Patch 1.1 / Experimental Branch! It *might* work just fine there, or it might crash your game. So use on 1.1 / experimental at your own risk!

## üöÄ Features

- Adds **Packaged Liquid Biofuel** to the list of compatible drone fuels.
  - "FlightSpeed" and "TravelSpeed" are set to match batteries. Seemed fitting since they're both "green"...ish.
  - Burn rate / fuel usage is just under half way between "regular" fuel and turbofuel. (I didn't see anywhere to edit this, so that happened "naturally.")
- Seamlessly integrates with the base game thanks to the awesome [ContentLib](https://ficsit.app/mod/ContentLib) mod made by Nogg-aholic and Robb! (Thanks, guys!)
- No additional configuration required ‚Äì just install and play! When you unlock drones (or if you already have), this update will be ready for you!

## üõ† Requirements

- Satisfactory *1.0*! (Yes, the stable version. I don't have a version ready for 1.1 yet -- stay tuned!)
